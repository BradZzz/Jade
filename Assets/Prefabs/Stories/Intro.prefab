  - 'In the beginning, god created the heavens and the earth. In the end he destroyed
    them, and in doing so, ended up destroying himself. '
  - 'From the rubble of armageddon, the Mohe were born. Rising from the remains of
    billions of shattered demon souls, the Mohe personified the sins from which they
    were created. '
  - 'Without a leader to guide them, the Mohe wandered the earth aimlessly for thousands
    of years. Through their wandering, they started to interact with the world. '
  - 'Meanwhile, the remaining shreds of humanity began to rebuild civilization. As
    they did, the Mohe were adopted into more and more of a symbiotic relationship. '
  - 'While some human masters use their Mohe for good, countless others use their
    Mohe for darker puposes. And so, with the old gods dead, new gods grew out of
    their ashes, challenging and fighting each other for superiority. '
  - 'It is 4762 AG. You are embarking on a pilgrimage to the site of the "Great Battle"
    with your trusty Mohe "Six". Good luck on your journey! '
